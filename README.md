### Hello, GitHub!

I'm new to the git world, but I do **love** to learn. 

I am dedicated to learning web and software development fundamentals and spend my time either *reading*, *researching*, or *exploring* video editing software and creative applications.

 - enjoy deep dive researches into various topics
 - self-taught HTML and CSS skills
 - expanding my knowledge in the world of AI and robotics

> I believe intelligence is *sacred* and technology should be crafted with *intention*.
